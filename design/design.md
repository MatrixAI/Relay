## Design Document

1.  Overall Design

    - Automatons need to be deployable within and outside a Matrix network
      without any changes to the code by the programmer.
    - Abstraction
      - containerised microservice
      - service abstraction
      - Relay sidecar service
        - flow and abstract network addresses
        - flow table
    - service discovery and routing
    - flow migration

1.1 Overview of Relay network
        
    - allow automatons to communicate with each other
    - implementation of high level service abstractions
    - balance load across automatons
    - route requests efficiently
    - allow the creation or removal of automatons
    -
