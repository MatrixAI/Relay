INTERHOST COMMUNICATION

This document tracks thoughts on interhost communication between orchestrator
nodes.

o we don't have control over what happens when packets are in flight
o hosts can reside on different networks and network types
  . do we need to do our own routing between hosts?
    
    I think yes we do because we can only assume that not all hosts will be on
    the same network. This is probably the safest assumption to make.

  . hosts can be virtual or physical, the orchestrator doesn't know and doesn't
    really care
o scale of the Matrix network
  . one host
  . a few hosts
  . many hosts
  . hundreds, thousands, even more hosts

o routing designs
  . ant colony routing
  . antnet

  Firstly it should probably be made clearer the structure of the orchestrator
  network.
