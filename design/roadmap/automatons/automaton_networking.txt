AUTOMATON NETWORKING

- automaton combinators
  o message
    . sends a message as a form of notification
    . doesn't take any form of response
  o request-response
    . sends a message as a request
    . expects a response
  o request-action[-response]
    . sends a message as a request
    . expects something to be performed
        , can be on behalf of the requester
        , something such as file transfer could be performed
        , could trigger other actions to be performed resulting in a response to
          the original requester

  Some possible combinators/examples are:
  o request response from left side
    A sends a request to B and receives a response from B.
  o response request from left side
    A receives a request from B and sends a response to B.
  o message from left side
    A sends a message to B.
  o message to left side
    A receives a message from B.

- statistics tracking

- migration
  o automaton name abstraction (mentioned as service name abstraction in other
    documents)
  o usage of flow ID to mark a communication flow between one container and
    another. This could even potentially be used to mark the communication flow
    between composed automatons.

- automaton communication
  o inter-automaton communication needs to be point-to-point from the
    perspective of the programs
