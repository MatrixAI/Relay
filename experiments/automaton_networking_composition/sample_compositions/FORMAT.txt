The first line of a composition file needs to declare the names of the
automatons, separate by white space.
eg. A B C
    apple banana crumpet

The next lines show the compositions. Each composition needs to be on a new line
with spaces between compositions. In between each automaton name, there needs to
be a composition operator which will be listed below.
eg. A -> B -> C
    apple => banana

The composition operators that this experiment will deal wtih are:
o ->
  Message from left to right
o =>
  Message from left to right and response from right to left
