IPVS
man ipvsadm(8)

- IP virtual server
- IP load balancing
- virtual server is an abstraction exposed to clients who see one service
  but in reality there's multiple services that can be easily scaled in the
  back

2 different types of load balancer types are:
- DNS based load balancing
- Dispatcher based load balancing (dedicated load balancer server)

- virtual server via NAT
- virtual server via IP Tunnelling
  - load balancer just schedules requests to different real servers which
    return replies directly to the user
  - servers and load balancer are required to have IP Encapsulation
    protocol
- virtual server via direct routing
  - requires one of the load balancer's interfaces and the real server's
    interfacesto be in the same physical segment
