KUBERNETES

- container/service orchestraion
- abstraction of services from the individual containers and physical machines
  which comprise a service

- Pod:
  A kubernetes pod is a single runnable processes. This can actually be
  consisted of multiple individual containers that are all interlinked, eg. 2
  containers, one running a web server and one running a database

  Pods can be easily replicated across multiple nodes. Pods are also ephemeral
  and tied to the Nodes they run on. Each pod has a unique IP address.

- Node:
  A physical

- Service:
  An abstraction of a logical set of pods and a policy on how to access them.

- by default, when a pod is created, it is only exposed (network wise) to the
  kubernetes cluster. To expose it to another network such as the localmachine,
  we need to create a service.
- scaling a service is as easy as `kubectl scale "deployment" --replicas="number
  of replicas"`
- rolling updates are performed automatically by kubernetes whenever a pod's
  image is updated
- undoing an update is as easy sa `kubectl rollout undo "deployment"`

I'm having a lot of difficulty getting kubernetes set up on NixOS.

minikube and virtualbox don't run
-> error setting up host only network on machine start
-> virtualbox host networking is enabled however

https://github.com/cstrahan/nixos-config/blob/master/configuration.nix
you can specifiy for kubelet to start up automatically by editing
configuration.nix
