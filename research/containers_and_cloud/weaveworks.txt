Weaveworks

- Saas for deployment, monitoring and management of containers and
  microservices (sounds like kubernetes?)
- maybe not? maybe Weaveworks is something to use with kubernetes?

" our infrastructure and platforms are becoming increasingly distributed
  but are enabled by a centralizing force " 

teams sometimes end up building a platform on top of Kubernetes (a
platform) in order to create a certain workflow

Weave Net
~~~~~~~~~~
- mini DNS server at each node
- no requirement of a central database for each cluster
- a weave network is made up of a number of peers which are weavenet
  routers on different hosts
- special topology messages so that all peers learn whos connected to who
  - spanning-tree based broadcast mechanism
  - neighbor gossip mechanism
- topology messages are sent when:
  - a connection is added
  - a connection is marked as 'established'
  - a connection is torn down
  - periodically the entire topology is "gossiped" to a subset of
    neighbours
- Weavenet is an overlay network between docker hosts
- Weave router is in userspace
- containers in weavenet are run on a private network so no address
  clashing
  They have an interface with Docker and weave, each providing separate
  networks
- weavenet can be used as a plugin for kubernetes for network policy

IMHO, I'm not the biggest fan of how weaveworks does this neworking.
Perhaps it is in fact a good way but I will have to see.
What I dont like about this:
- mini DNS server at each node
- purely an overlay network to allow docker containers to talk to each
  other. it has no abstract functionalities on top of this such as service
  abstractions or ephemeral containers - topology attempts to deal with
  ephemeral containers but doesn't do this well
- it... feels low effort/low tech. There's nothing new here.. as in it's
  tech that's just duct-taped together to link docker containers.
- this weavenet module i feel is built to simply be a standalone module
  with no interoperability (perhaps wrong about this with my brief
  overview)

What's not too bad:
- topology messages - it's not that bad. but also not the best. Gossiping
  is pretty good. I believe I've heard about it in blockchains? but i think
  if left unchecked, could lead to network cluttering.
- each node seems to have a good idea of the overall topology which allows
  the addition of software control over the control plane to be programmed
  and run on each node
