difference-between-a-traditional-switch-and-openflow-switch#20017

- split data and control planes
  - both Serval and Scion both are suggesting this
  - I see _OPENFLOW_
    - This is also in the readings to do 
- SDN:
  - Directly programmable - network control is directly programmable
    because it's decoupled from forwarding functions
  - Agile - abstracting control from forwarding lets admins adjust
    network-wide traffic flow
  - Centrally managed - network intelligence is logically centralised in
    software controllers *which have a global overview of the network*
  - Programmatically configured
  - Open standards-based and vendor-neutral

- Key things driving the need for a new network paradigm:
  - Changing traffic patterns
    - client talks to 1 server which communicates with a few machines
      before returning
  - consumerization
    - access to corp nets with mobile devices
  - cloud services
  - bandwidth required for services
    - big data transfers/high demend on servers
- Limitations of current network tech:
  - Network cannot dynamically adapt to changing traffic, application and
    user demands
  - inconsistent policies and difficulty of making sure policies are
    consistent across all devices on a network
  - vendor and hardware dependent

- SDN controllers maintain a global view of the network

- OpenFlow is an implementation of a SDN Controller
  - it is a wire protocol that can be used to program an IP forwarding
    table

- SDN is a *paradigm* about changing the way we manage networks
- Having a *central server* or really anything that is *conscious* /
  knowledgeable of network flow allows rules about how traffic flows (eg.
  non-important traffic can take a slightly slower route in order for
  important traffic to travel faster) to be defined
- SDN can test packets against a firewall. If packets are accepted, then
  further packets can potentially be assumed to be safe and bypass the
  firewall
- Control plane level load balancing
