NEMO protocol
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3963

The following link is the RFC for Mobile IPv6 published 2011. The above NEMO
RFC was published 2005. It's just there to say hey I've opened the link but
haven't actually bothered to look at it because it's outdated.

- IP tunneling
  - home address and care-of address (temporary IP address for a mobile device)
- something that won't work for the internet but may work for smaller networks
  is to propagate route changes while maintaining the same IP address. BEWARE
  THOUGH
- link-layer handoff

- the following diagram is pulled from rfc5944 pg14

               2) Datagram is intercepted   3) Datagram is
                  by home agent and            detunneled and
                  is tunneled to the           delivered to the
                  care-of address.             mobile node.

The following points address Mobile IPv6
- mobile IPv6 does away with the need for "foreign agents"
- A mobile node is always able to be addressed at its home address whether it is
  on its home network or not
- when a mobile node is attached to a foreign link, it is also addressable at
  one or more of the care-of addresses
- binding is the association between a mobile node's "home address" and care-of
  address
- communication modes:
  o bidirectional tunneling:
    all communication from correspondant to mobile node is done through the
    home agent
  o route optimization:
    mobile node registers its current binding at the correspondent node. Packets
    from the correspondent node can be routed directly to the care-oif address
    of the mobile node
- support for multiple home agents
- i think the diagram for Mobile IPv4 is adequate to describe the high-level
  overview of Mobile IPv6 well enough
