Main thing we need to be able to manage is transferring of state out of machines
shutting down to new machines and whether we need to transfer state or we can
let a new connection be established

- state machine replication
  is this the kind of thing we want? maybe it's ok for things with minimal state
  but in services which handle millions of requests, we'll have millions of
  states to manage and replication is just not worth it :: ._. ::

  risk tradeoff - having replication would help mitigate the effects of
  unexpected outtages or adversarial effects on networks (congestion due to
  heavy traffic/DDos on large system etc.) but perhaps may not be necessary to
  all users of a Matrix network

  LET USERS OPT IN TO REPLICATION

- CAP principle
  Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
