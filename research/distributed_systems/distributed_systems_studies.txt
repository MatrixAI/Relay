- distributed systems design principles
  o Web distributed systems design
    
    Availability
    Performance
    Reliability
    Scalability
    Manageability
    Cost

  o CAP theorem
  
    Consistency
      Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
    Availability
      Always will get a non-error response.
    Partition Tolerance
      System continues to operate despite break in communication.

- monitoring and statistics at the forefront

- reasons for failure of systems
  o realistically, it's more often than not going to be a SOFTWARE fault

- service oriented architecture
  o splitting each thing that the overall service needs to do into smaller
  services so that they can be independently scaled and upgraded without
  effecting the other parts

- shared-nothing architecture (flat p2p)

- vertical scaling

- horizontal scaling
  o sharding/partitioning
    . exploits parallelism to make large amounts of small workloads
    . no need to communicate between shards

    Flickr (this may be slightly old)
      . Shards are a slice of the main database.
      . Active Master-Master Ring Replication
      . a user is stuck to a server in a shard
      . each server in a shard is at 50% load, allowing for failures and
        upgrades

  o clusters
    . groups of machines (virtual or physical), generally behind a load balancer
    . multiple clusters spread geographically

- load balancing
