- IP addresses are assigned to interfaces rather than nodes
  - routing table sizes are much bigger than they need to be because
    multiple interfaces can lead to the same node
  - makes multihoming and mobility harder to achieve
  - fragmentation of TCP packets at IP layer is annoying and headers can be
    misconfigured/misinterpreted after the frag
  - IP addresses identify location and identity
- TCP
  - congestion detection and avoidance depends on congestion
    notification/delay which varies largely
  - detection mechanisms are only triggered when congestion is detected,
    not before
  - congestion mechanisms can be triggered when there is no congestion

- Based on the IPC model (Inter-Process Communication model)
- distributed application facilities (DAFs) -> made up of 2 or more
  distributed app processes (DAPs). These DAPs communicate using a single
  application protocol called a CDAP (Common Distributed Application
  Protocol)

                   Distributed Application Facility (DAF)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                           CDAP messages                     |
    |  DAP_A <-------------------------------------------> DAP_B  |
    |                                                             |
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

- In order to exchange information, DAPs have an underlying facility which
  provides comms services to them. This is another DAF called a DIF
  (distributed IPC facility)
- A DIF can be thought of as a layer and allows a DAP to allocate flows to
  one or more DAPs
- DIFs can also use other underlying DIFs - recursive use of the same layer
  but just to differing scopes

- The diagram on wikipedia of an example of RINA networks and IPC processes
  is just too confusing. It seems like this may have some merit but is
  extremely bloated (maybe there's a reason to it being this complex)

- RINA features:
  - perspective that networking is not layers of different functions but a
    single layer of distributed IPC over different scopes
  - supports multihoming and mobility and helps prevent routing table
    explosion and scales well
  - other features on wikipedia. not sure what they mean rn

ip-vs-rina/

- recurring pattern of distributed computing
  - "Communicate this for me from here to over there" followed by 'how'
- benefits of RINA compared to TCP/IP:
  - scalability - recursive structure
  - security
  - performance
  - manageability
  - flexibility
  - reliability
  - mobility
  - cost
