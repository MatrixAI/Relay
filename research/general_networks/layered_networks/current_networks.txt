OSI models
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model

- 7 layers
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8 mentions layers 8, 9, 10

(government or legal compliance)
(the organization)
(the individual user)

- each layer serves those above it and is served by those below it
- it's served the current internet pretty well
- the 7 layers represent different layers in the network stack
- by having a look at this, we can see some issues that networks need to
  overcome in order to function

Physical 
  - transmission and reception of raw bit streams over physical
    mediums
Data link
  - reliable transmission of data frames between 2 nodes connected
    by a physical layer
Network
  - structuring and managing a multi-node network including
    addressing, routing and traffic control
Transport
  - reliable transmission of data segments between points ona network,
    including segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing
Session
  - managing communication sessions ie. continuous exchange of information
Presentation
  - Translation of data between a networkign service and an application
    including character encoding, data compression and encryption/
    decryption
Application
  - high level APIs such as resource sharing, remote file access

Good things about OSI model:
  - rather simple to visualise and understand - we're all pretty good at
    stacking things in our minds
  - hey it works
  - splits up work pretty well. We have different levels of abstractions to
    build on top of

- cross-layer functions - functions that aren't tied to a specific layer
  and may affect more than 1 layer
  - security
  - management
  - ARP
  - DHCP
  - DNS
  - Cross MAC and PHY scheduling (wifi networks and packet scheduling)

- OSI differs a bit from TCP/IP model

This one is a lot simpler and probably is better to use compared to OSI.
We can see that OSI isn't as popular because of the sheer amount of crap in
it. TCP/IP is so much simpler and gets the job done.

- simplicity is good

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OSI and TCP/IP design tied to old telephone systems
  - routing and switching for interface to interface communication
  - the 'thin waist' of IP networks 

client-server architecture follows much the same train of thought

we're only seeing widespread distributed computing recently so fair enough
about the current design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another Internet architecture -> RINA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_InterNetwork_Architecture_(RINA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- IP addresses are assigned to interfaces rather than nodes
  - routing table sizes are much bigger than they need to be because
    multiple interfaces can lead to the same node
  - makes multihoming and mobility harder to achieve
  - fragmentation of TCP packets at IP layer is annoying and headers can be
    misconfigured/misinterpreted after the frag
  - IP addresses identify location and identity
- TCP
  - congestion detection and avoidance depends on congestion
    notification/delay which varies largely
  - detection mechanisms are only triggered when congestion is detected,
    not before
  - congestion mechanisms can be triggered when there is no congestion


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apparently 3 laws of networking?
define attenuation - the gradual diminishing in the strength of something

Quality attenuation exists
  - a network is a bit like a piston with pressure, volume and temperature,
    setting 2 of them will set the third
  - the 3 network parameters seem to be
    Load - generally a network cannot predict or deal with load
    Loss
    Delay
Quality attenuation is conserved
  - we can't undrop a packet or unqueue a queued one
Quality attenuation is tradable
  - loss and delay can be traded sometimes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- in TCP/IP model, there is a resonance effect where small changes or
  fluctuations are amplified or dimished based on factors out of the
  control of the network

- Old circuit networks -> Network of Promises
- Modern day internet -> Network of possibilities (nothing is guaranteed)
- Network of possibilities
  - manages contention not bandwith
    contention is the real resource of networks not bandwith
      contention is when a packet sits around waiting for other packets

- Need to consider different flow types, bursts, queues etc.
