- linux uses iptables to figure out where packets need to go and whether
  they should be allowed or dropped
- I run arch linux. To check my ip tables, i run
  `sudo iptables -nvL`
- iptables is a stateful firewall

- The following netfilter hooks are available. As packets progress through
  the kernel's network stack, various hooks will be triggered.
  NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING
    triggered by incoming traffic soon after entering the network stack and
    before any routing decisions have been made
  NF_IP_LOCAL_IN
    hook is triggered after incoming traffic is routed and is destined for
    the local system
  NF_IP_FORWARD
    hook is triggered after incoming traffic is routed and is to be
    forwarded to another host
  NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT
    triggered as soon as locally created outbound packet hits the network
    stack
  NF_IP_POST_ROUTING
    triggered as soon as any outbound/forwarded traffic is about to leave

- The following chains are availeble:
  PREROUTING
    triggers NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING
  INPUT
    triggers NF_IP_LOCAL_IN
  FORWARD
    triggers NF_IP_FORWARD
  OUTPUT
    triggers NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT
  POSTROUTING
    triggers NF_IP_POST_ROUTING

- The tables available are:
  Filter
    Whether to let a packet continue to its destination.
  NAT
    Implement network address translation rules. Determines how to modify
    packets.
  Mangle
    To edit IP headers. Allows the adding of an internal mark to the packet
    for the kernel to use in other tables.
  Raw
    Provide a mechanism for marking packets in order to opt-out of
    connection tracking (iptables is stateful and so tracks connections)
  Security
    Put security marks on packets (can be per packet or per connection) so
    security systems can handle the packets as per policy.

  Each table will have multiple chains depending on the policies. When
  there are multiple chains associated with the same hook, there will be a
  priority level assigned to each chain. The chain with the highest
  priority will be completely evaluated before moving on etc.

- users can define their own chains but these chains can only be reached
  by jumping to it from a rule


Here lies a flowchart showing how packets flow through iptables.

- connecting a LAN to the internet via NAT
  `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
- when using NAT functionality, tcpdump will pick up traffic after it has gone
  through NAT, at least when using the OUTPUT chain

- there doesn't seem to be a userspace library for iptables. perhaps the best
  way to do it is `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore`

  According to
  https://www.mail-archive.com/netfilter-devel@lists.samba.org/msg00456.html
  iptables-restore and iptables both do atomic transacations

  I think this version of atomic means that the firewall will never be in a
  semi-configured state.
