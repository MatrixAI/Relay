- comments in the first link:
  - "wouldnt macvlan reintroduce MAC address explosion?"
    "yes it would. MACVLAN isn't a solution for general purpose containers. used
    as a stepping stone when shifting between VMs and containers."

- MACVLANs allow the use of an existing dhcp server as each interface has a
  different MAC address
- a macvaln allows the configuration of multiple layer 2 addresses to a single
  physical device

"The macvlan is a trivial bridge that doesn't need to do learning as it knows
every mac address it can receive, so it doesn't need to implement learning or
stp. Which makes it simple stupid and and fast."

- third link above gives an example of Docker containers and setting one up with
  a macvlan
