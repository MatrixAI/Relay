TODO list

This list just has points that potentially have interest. Most probably won't be
of interest but at least are worth having a look at.

- p2p vpn/network layer tunelling
  o zerotier
    > location of peers via external mechanisms (dns-like root servers)
    > p2p
  o wireguard
    > potentially useful for interhost networking. However we'd need to see
    about how flexible the configuration of peers are in order to allow new
    hosts to come online and old ones to drop out
    > interested in how a new 'wireguard' device is created. i think it's worth
    looking at source code
  o ipvs
    > layer 4 switching which means underlying network protocol HAS to be IP and
    we HAVE to have a transport protocol of either TCP, UDP or SCTP
    > has NAT, direct tunnelling and IP encapsulation. All are concepts relevant
    to Relay but layer 4 switching may be too restrictive.
- general networking tools/design
  o bpf
  o netfilter architecture
  o linux networking stack
  o userspace networking
    > snabb
  o BGP and variants
- distributed systems/computing
  o gossip protocols
  o chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems, Google
  o sharding
  o other blockchain things
  o state replication/consistency
  o general distributed systems design
- load balancing
  o nginx
  o warp
  o haproxy

- other things of general interest to possibly skim through
  o weird as it sounds, I think the following could be worth at least looking at
    quickly
    . USB and other hardware interfaces
    . NFS
    . vehicle routing problems

Things the next experiment may examine:
  - lower level networking rules
  - automaton composition rules specified from a file
  - flowID representing an automaton's connection in a composition
